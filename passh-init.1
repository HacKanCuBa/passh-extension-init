.SH NAME
passh init - A \fBpassh\fP(1) extension that provides a convenient solution to
initialize the store altogether with git, plus signing commits.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpassh init\fP [\fI--help\fP,\fI-h\fP] [ \fI--path=sub-folder\fP, \fI-p sub-folder\fP ] [\fI--git\fP,\fI-g\fP] [\fI--sign\fP,\fI-s\fP] \fIgpg-id\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpassh init\fP Provides an interactive solution initialize new password storage and use
.I gpg-id
for encryption. Multiple gpg-ids may be specified, in order to encrypt each
password with multiple ids. This command must be run first before a password
store can be used. If the specified \fIgpg-id\fP is different from the key
used in any existing files, these files will be reencrypted to use the new id.
Note that use of
.BR gpg-agent (1)
is recommended so that the batch decryption does not require as much user
intervention. If \fI--path\fP or \fI-p\fP is specified, along with an argument,
a specific gpg-id or set of gpg-ids is assigned for that specific sub folder of
the password store. If only one \fIgpg-id\fP is given, and it is an empty string,
then the current \fI.gpg-id\fP file for the specified \fIsub-folder\fP (or root if
unspecified) is removed.
Additionally, \fI--git\fP or \fI-g\fP initializes the git repository (same as 
passh git init).
Optionally, --sign or -s can be passed to temporarily set PASSWORD_STORE_SIGNING_KEY 
to \fIgit-id\fP.
If PASSWORD_STORE_SIGNING_KEY is set (either by --sign or externally), it will 
be used to sign \fB.gpg-id\fP files and also commits (if git is initialized or 
already exists). Note that only the first key in PASSWORD_STORE_SIGNING_KEY 
is used to sign commits! (this is a git limitation).
